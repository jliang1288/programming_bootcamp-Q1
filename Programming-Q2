# Programming Task #2
# How it Works:
# 1. Generate a secret number between 1 and 100 using the randint()
# 2. Implement a While Loop. While <guess> does not equal the secret number, continue looping through the following code
#    0. Note: We can initialise (guess = None) outside to run the while loop.
#    a. Ask user for an input. This is their guess
#    b. Check this input ( A function will check whether the input is valid - ie) .isdigit() and between 1 and 100)
#       i. If the input is valid
#          - Run a function to check which message to display
#          - Then run a function to print the message off
#      ii. If the input is invalid
#          - Inform the user that their input is invalid
#          - Run the While loop again (which asks for a guess again)

# Why it works
# When we try to guess a number - we instinctively ask conditional questions
# Eg Is my number lower or higher than the secret number?
# By writing out a code for what we do instinctively, ie) with if statements
# we can effectively code up a game that asks users to guess a secret number.
